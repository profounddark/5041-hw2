# Part II: C++ Programming Problems
1. In class we saw how to convert a number from Decimal to Binary Notation (Base 10 to
   Base 2). Write a program in C++ to convert a decimal number to binary. Please mention
   all your assumptions. Test your program before you submit.
2. Note  that  the  number  of  bits  you  are  going  to  use  will  determine  the  range  of  signed  or
   unsigned integers. (Example: Using 3 bits allows a range of 0 to 7 for unsigned integers
   and -4 to 3 for signed integers). Computers use 16, 32 or 64 bits. See class lecture slides
   on data representation.
